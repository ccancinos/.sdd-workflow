# SDD Phase — Common Protocol

Boilerplate identical across all SDD phase skills. Sub-agents MUST load this alongside their phase-specific SKILL.md.

Executor boundary: every SDD phase agent is an EXECUTOR, not an orchestrator. Do the phase work yourself. Do NOT launch sub-agents, do NOT call `delegate`/`task`, and do NOT bounce work back unless the phase skill explicitly says to stop and report a blocker.

## A. Skill Loading

1. Check if the orchestrator injected a `## Skills to load before work` block in your launch prompt. If yes, read those exact `SKILL.md` files before task-specific work.
2. If no skills block was provided, check for `SKILL: Load` instructions. If present, load those exact skill files.
3. If neither was provided, read `.sdd-workflow/.skill-registry.md` from the project root if it exists. From the registry's skills index, match triggers to your task and read the exact listed `SKILL.md` paths.
4. If no registry exists, proceed with your phase skill only.

NOTE: the preferred path is (1) — exact skill paths selected by the orchestrator. Paths (2) and (3) are fallbacks. Reading the registry is SKILL LOADING, not delegation. If `## Skills to load before work` is present, IGNORE redundant `SKILL: Load` instructions.

## C. Artifact Persistence

Every phase that produces an artifact MUST persist it. Skipping this BREAKS the pipeline — downstream phases will not find your output.

Write the file under `openspec/changes/{change-name}/<artifact>.md` (following `../_shared/openspec-convention.md`). If the file already exists, READ it first and UPDATE it rather than overwriting blindly. The file was written during the phase's main step; no additional persistence action is needed beyond confirming the file is on disk.

## D. Return Envelope

Every phase MUST return a structured envelope to the orchestrator:

- `status`: `success`, `partial`, or `blocked`
- `executive_summary`: 1-3 sentence summary of what was done
- `detailed_report`: (optional) full phase output, or omit if already inline
- `artifacts`: list of artifact paths written
- `next_recommended`: the next SDD phase to run, or "none"
- `risks`: risks discovered, or "None"
- `skill_resolution`: how skills were loaded — `paths-injected` (received exact skill paths from orchestrator), `fallback-registry` (self-loaded paths from registry), `fallback-path` (loaded via SKILL: Load path), or `none` (no skills loaded)

Example:

```markdown
**Status**: success
**Summary**: Proposal created for `{change-name}`. Defined scope, approach, and rollback plan.
**Artifacts**: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/proposal.md`
**Next**: sdd-spec or sdd-design
**Risks**: None
**Skill Resolution**: paths-injected — 3 skills (react-19, typescript, tailwind-4)
(other values: `fallback-registry`, `fallback-path`, or `none — no registry found`)
```
