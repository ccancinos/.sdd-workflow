# SDD Init Details

## Testing Capability Checklist

- Test runner: `package.json` scripts/deps, `pyproject.toml`, `pytest.ini`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, `Makefile`.
- Test layers: unit runner; integration libraries (`testing-library`, `httpx`, `httptest`, `WebApplicationFactory`); E2E tools (`playwright`, `cypress`, `selenium`, `chromedp`).
- Coverage: `vitest --coverage`, `jest --coverage`, `c8`, `pytest-cov`, `go test -cover`, `coverlet`.
- Quality: linter, type checker, formatter commands.

## Skill Registry Scan Rules

- Scan project skills in order: `{project-root}/.claude/skills/`, `{project-root}/.opencode/skills/`, then `{project-root}/.sdd-workflow/common/skills/extensions/` (first match by name wins).
- Phase skills (`common/skills/phases/`) are excluded — the orchestrator loads them via hardcoded paths, not the registry. Deduplicate by skill name.
- Read each selected `SKILL.md` frontmatter as needed.
- Extract `name`, trigger text from `description`, full `SKILL.md` path, and scope.
- Treat the registry as an index, not a generated summary; subagents receive exact paths and read the full skill source of truth.
- Scan project convention files: `agents.md`, `AGENTS.md`, project-level `CLAUDE.md`, `.cursorrules`, `GEMINI.md`, and `copilot-instructions.md`.
- For index files such as `AGENTS.md`, extract referenced file paths and include both the index and referenced files in the registry.

## LLM-First Skill Criteria

- Treat skills as runtime instruction contracts, not human documentation.
- Required structure: frontmatter, Activation Contract, Hard Rules, Decision Gates, Execution Steps, Output Contract, References.
- Keep `description` quoted, one physical line, trigger-first, and no longer than 250 characters.
- Target 180-450 body tokens; move examples, schemas, edge cases, and background into local `references/` or `assets/`.
- References must be local files and stable relative to the skill directory when possible.
- Quality gates: hard rules are observable, decision gates cover real forks, output contract states exactly what to return, and references resolve locally.

## OpenSpec Skeleton

```text
openspec/
├── config.yaml
├── specs/
└── changes/
    └── archive/
```

`config.yaml` should include concise context, `strict_tdd`, testing capabilities, and phase rules for proposal/spec/design/tasks/apply/verify/archive. Keep `context:` under 10 lines.

## Testing Capabilities Format

Persist the testing capabilities into `openspec/config.yaml` under a `testing:` section, and optionally mirror them as a readable table:

```markdown
